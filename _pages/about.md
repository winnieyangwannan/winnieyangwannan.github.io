###  Welcome to My Corner of the Web! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Winnie, a PhD candidate at New York University (NYU)'s [Buzsakilab](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/publications/),
where I'm decoding the content of 'dream' (replay) to unravel the mechanism of
[memory consolidation during sleep](https://winnieyangwannan.github.io/RippleTagging/) (my work was recently published in
[Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk8261)).

### From Neuroscience to AI Safety
As fascinating as brain research is, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a profound shift in
my research focus. I've come to recognize that ensuring the safety of artificial intelligence is one of the most critical
challenges of our time!
 

### Current Focus
I've started the exciting journey of transitioning from neuroscience to AI safety research. My current interests include:

- [Interpretability for safe AI](https://winnieyangwannan.github.io/LLM_Deception/) 
- Adversarial robustness
