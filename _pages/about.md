###  Welcome to My Corner of the Web! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Winnie, a PhD candidate at NYU's [Buzsakilab](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/publications/),
where I'm decoding rodent 'dreams' to unravel the mysteries of [memory consolidation during sleep](https://winnieyangwannan.github.io/RippleTagging/).

### From Neuroscience to AI Safety
As fascinating as brain research is, recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a profound shift in
my research focus. I've come to recognize that ensuring the safety of artificial intelligence is one of the most critical
challenges of our time!
 

### Current Focus
I'm in the process of transitioning from neuroscience to AI safety research. My current interests include:

- Interpretability in AI systems
- Adversarial robustness
